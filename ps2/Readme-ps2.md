## Description
Explain what the project does.

### Features
Describe what your major decisions were and why you did things that way.  How did you represent fractal elements and how did you compute their positions?

### Issues
What did you have trouble with?  What did you learn?  What doesn't work?  Be honest.  You might be penalized if you claim something works and it doesn't.

### Extra Credit
Anything special you did.  This is required to earn bonus points.

# Triangle Fractal

## Name
Manasa Praveen

## Functionality
This program generates a recursive Triangle Fractal using SFML. The user provides:
- `L`: The length of one side of the base triangle
- `N`: The recursion depth

## Features
- Recursive fractal drawing
- Window adapts to image size
- Properly placed sub-triangles

## Extra Credit
- Color variation based on recursion depth
- Rotation feature included

## Screenshot
(Include an actual screenshot here)

## Compilation
Run `make` to compile, then execute `./Triangle <L> <N>`
