# PS0: Hello SFML

## Description
The project is supposed to be a basic sfml project, that requires students to build a sprite (movable object) and program it to move and respond to keystrokes. We are laos given the liverty to add some new feature that goes beyond the scope of the project.

### Features
I think one of the major decisions I had to make for this project was brainstorming a special feature. I had to think really hard about what I wanted to add to my sprite. I ended uo adding audio to my spaceship launch, and I also added bkacground color that changes based on time. I used the Clock class in my project and when 4 seconds elapses the background color should change from a lighter blue to a darker blue.

Additionally, I also had a bit of trouble compiling my sfml works project. I had spent a bit of time trying to figure out why my main file will not compile, only to later realize it is because I had the wrong version in my Makefile:((

### Extra Feature
I not only added 1 special feature but 3 different ones to my project. I added an audio which I though paired well with the rocket photo, so I have an audio of a rocket launch. In addition to that I also used the Clock class and used the elapsedTime function to change the background color from light blue to dark blue.

### Issues
What doesn't work.  Be honest.  You might be penalized if you claim something works and it doesn't.
From what I have seen my code should completely work. I do have the sfml 3.0.0 and boost 1.87.0 versions just as a disclaimer if it doesn't work on some other devices it could be because of the version difference.


## Integrity
Read the University policy Academic Integrity, and answer the following question:

There are nine examples of academic misconduct, labeled (1) through (9). Other than (1), "Seeks to claim credit for the work or efforts of another without authorization or citation," which of these do you think would most apply to this class, and why? Write approx. 100-200 words. Note: there is no single correct answer to this. I am looking for your opinion.

I think clause 9 which states "Uses generative AI tools, such as chatbots, image generators, or code generators, to complete assignments, exams, or any other academic work without explicit permission from the instructor" very closely applies to this class. I think because of how readily available AI tools are often students use them not for enrichment purposes like learning concepts but rather to just get their work done. Especially, in computing where often complex code is being used and understanding the reasoning behind these lines of code are very important but by relying on AI tools to write code in your stead, a person robs themselves of the opportunity to think for themselves. I find that debugging in code can be tedious but is incredibly rewarding, and is a process that allows me to better comprehend my code and understand the underlying processes. However, in such cases AI tools can be used not to help debug but rather rewrite code completely, which defeats the purpose.
