# PS0: Hello SFML

## Contact
Name: Manasa Praveen

Section: 202

Time to Complete: 2 hours


## Description
The project is supposed to be a basic sfml project, that requires students to build a sprite (movable object) and program it to move and respond to keystrokes.

### Features
I think one of the major decisions I had to make for this project was brainstorming a special feature. I had to think really hard about what I wanted to add to my sprite.
Additionally, I also had a bit of trouble compiling my sfml works project. I had spent a bit of time trying to figure out why my main file will not compile, only to later realize it is because I had the wrong version in my Makefile:((

### Extra Feature
Describe anything special you did.  This is required to earn points.

### Issues
What doesn't work.  Be honest.  You might be penalized if you claim something works and it doesn't.


## Integrity
Read the University policy Academic Integrity, and answer the following question:

There are nine examples of academic misconduct, labeled (1) through (9). Other than (1), "Seeks to claim credit for the work or efforts of another without authorization or citation," which of these do you think would most apply to this class, and why? Write approx. 100-200 words. Note: there is no single correct answer to this. I am looking for your opinion.
I think clause 9 which states "Uses generative AI tools, such as chatbots, image generators, or code generators, to complete assignments, exams, or any other academic work without explicit permission from the instructor" very closely applies to this class. I think because of how readily available AI tools are often students use them not for enrichment purposes like learning concepts but rather to just get their work done. Especially, in computing where often complex code is being used and understanding the reasoning behind these lines of code are very important but by relying on AI tools to write code in your stead, a person robs themselves of the opportunity to think for themselves. I find that debugging in code can be tedious but is incredibly rewarding, and is a process that allows me to better comprehend my code and understand the underlying processes. However, in such cases AI tools can be used not to help debug but rather rewrite code completely, which defeats the purpose.
