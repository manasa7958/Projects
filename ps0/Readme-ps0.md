# PS0: Hello SFML

Time to Complete: 2 hours


## Description
The project is supposed to be a basic sfml project, that requires students to build a sprite (movable object) and program it to move and respond to keystrokes.

### Features
I think one of the major decisions I had to make for this project was brainstorming a special feature. I had to think really hard about what I wanted to add to my sprite.
Additionally, I also had a bit of trouble compiling my sfml works project. I had spent a bit of time trying to figure out why my main file will not compile, only to later realize it is because I had the wrong version in my Makefile:((

### Extra Feature
Describe anything special you did.  This is required to earn points.

### Issues
What doesn't work.  Be honest.  You might be penalized if you claim something works and it doesn't.


## Integrity
Read the University policy Academic Integrity, and answer the following question:

There are nine examples of academic misconduct, labeled (1) through (9). Other than (1), "Seeks to claim credit for the work or efforts of another without authorization or citation," which of these do you think would most apply to this class, and why? Write approx. 100-200 words. Note: there is no single correct answer to this. I am looking for your opinion.
