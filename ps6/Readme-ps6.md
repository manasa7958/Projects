## Description
The project implements a Random Writer that predicts the characters
This project implements a Random Writer using a Markov model of order k to generate text that mimics the statistical structure of a source input. The model builds a frequency table of kgrams and the characters that follow them, and uses this to stochastically generate new text of a specified length
