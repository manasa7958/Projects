## Description
This is the first part of the project so all I am doing is making tests in my test.cpp file.

#### Part a
I made an InvalidInput test, EdgeCase Test, LFSROutput test, and modified the GeneratInstr test.

#### Part b

### Issues
What doesn't work.  Be honest.  You might be penalized if you claim something works and it doesn't.
As of now I have been having some trouble when trying to run my tests.

### Tests
Describe what is being tested in your Boost unit tests.
The string is being tested to make sure that is is indeed 16-bit, does not contain an invalid characters, etc.
